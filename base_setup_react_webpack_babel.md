# Base setup for React-Webpack-Babel

As you may know, a lot of React boilerplate projects are around there, but most of the times these boilerplate projects not fits our needs. In this articale I'll not reflect how to boilerplate a project, I'll try to show you how to setup your own project without boilerplate project.

In this article we'll setup a project using our lovely React framework, packaging it with Webpack and of course we'll deal with Babel and Hot Realoading.

But, Why not [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)? 
Yes, this is great way to bootstrap a boilerplate React project and it is introduced by Facebook, but it comes without any build confguration. I would recommend it for the begginers who is getting started with React, for those how don't bother with a setup of Webpack, Babel and Hot Reloading.

At some point we faced a situation when you need some build/packeging tools around your React project. 

I hope this article will help you into setting basic project structure and build configuration. Enough, let's start our base setup for React(Webpack, Babel, Hot Reloading) project.

## Project Setup

Let's start with the begining, you'll need some development env. setup to start. So, make sure you have an editor and terminal on your computer, also check if you have an installed version of [node and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/).

In this chapter we will focus on setting up the project. Open you terminal and create a folder for our project, after initialize it as npm project.

```bat
mkdir base-react-boilerplate
cd base-react-boilerplate
npm init -y
```
```-y``` will initialize our projects with default configurations and generates the _package.json_ file. This file contains the configuration and intalled node packages and scripts, for now we do not have some packages intalled, we'll add some later on.
