# Base setup for React-Webpack-Babel

As you may know, a lot of React boilerplate projects are around there, but most of the times these boilerplate projects not fits our needs. In this articale I'll not reflect how to boilerplate a project, I'll try to show you how to setup your own project without boilerplate project.

In this article we'll setup a project using our lovely React framework, packaging it with Webpack and of course we'll deal with Babel and Hot Realoading.

But, Why not [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)? 
Yes, this is great way to bootstrap a boilerplate React project and it is introduced by Facebook, but it comes without any build confguration. I would recommend it for the begginers who is getting started with React, for those how don't bother with a setup of Webpack, Babel and Hot Reloading.

At some point we faced a situation when you need some build/packeging tools around your React project. 

I hope this article will help you into setting basic project structure and build configuration. Enough, let's start our base setup for React(Webpack, Babel, Hot Reloading) project.
